# School_District_Analysis

In my role as a Data Analyst, I worked with Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, to analyze information from multiple sources. Our goal was to prepare standardized test data for analysis and reporting, and ultimately visualize the data to create a presentation that would provide insights into performance trends and patterns within the district's schools.

Based on our analysis, we have found that public schools have a higher budget than charter schools. While public schools have a slightly lower math score than charter schools, they perform well in other areas. Furthermore, Montgomery High School has the largest student population, while Chang High School has the lowest.
